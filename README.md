tinyCompiler
============

a course project of Compilers


Usage: ./tinyCompiler [lex.txt]


In fact, the whole course project involves four parts. However, for now, I only finished the first two parts.

The specfic design proposals for the first two parts are in the doc `design for lexical analyzer.pdf` and `design for syntax analyzer.pdf`, respectively.
